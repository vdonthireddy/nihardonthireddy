    <p>Hi, my name is Nihar Donthireddy and I'm a senior in high school. I'm passionate about creating YouTube videos and helping raise funds for children with cancer.
    </p>
    <p>
    I started my YouTube channel when I was in middle school. I wanted to create videos that would educate people, and I also wanted to use my platform to raise awareness about cancer. My channel has grown over the past few years, and I've been able to raise hundreds of dollars for cancer research and support organizations.
    </p>
    <p>
    I'm so grateful for the opportunity to use my skills and passion to make a difference in the lives of children with cancer. I know that I can't cure cancer, but I can help to raise money for research and support organizations. I can also use my platform to raise awareness about cancer and its impact on children and families.
    </p>
    <p>Thank you for your support!</p>
