            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Nihar Donthireddy and I'm a senior in high school. I'm passionate about creating YouTube
                videos and helping raise funds for children with cancer.</p>
            <p>
                I started my YouTube channel when I was in middle school. I wanted to create videos that would educate
                people, and I also wanted to use my platform to raise awareness about cancer. My channel has grown over
                the past few years, and I've been able to raise hundreds of dollars for cancer research and support
                organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm so grateful for the opportunity to use my skills and passion to make a difference in the lives of
                children with cancer. I know that I can't cure cancer, but I can help to raise money for research and
                support organizations. I can also use my platform to raise awareness about cancer and its impact on
                children and families.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for your support!</p><br/>
